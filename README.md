# Angular-1.x---Code-Lab
This code lab was created for the sake of DZ 
Geek Hangouts ! it had two folder : **Back End Folder** and **Front End** one

### Dependency Setup :

Go to each one of the folder and write the following if you're in **Front End** 
level and of course you have to configure your **Dev Machine** with 
[Bower](bower.io)

```bash
$ bower install
```

And if you're in the **Back End** folder simple use **NPM** Bundled with 
**NodeJS**

```bash
$ npm install
```

 This will add new folders to your working folders and then simple launch your 
 code !! 

 ### Lunch the Code : 

 For your **Back End** simply work with **nodemon** or simple use : 

 ```bash
 $ node api
 ```

 and if you're in the **Front End** level, in case you have **python**
 installed in your **Dev Machine** simple type : 

 ```bash
 $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

 ```

 So you can create a local server, and notice that your **Angular** code
 won't run unless you have a **Local Server**

**And you're Done !**
